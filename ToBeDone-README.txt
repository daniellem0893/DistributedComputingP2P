What needs to be done:

Be able to run multiple server-router instances
Connect multiple nodes (clients) to these server-routers 
Include node's IP and other info in the routing table
Allow nodes to specify which other node they want to communicate with and have the Server-Routers of each node connect to share the information
Allow the nodes to send a message between each other with the new information (IP address) and convert messages to uppercase
Server-Routers communicate via sockets
The two nodes will also communicate via sockets, just each party is missing information
Repeat Data Collection for analysis like in part 1
